# üìå Law-RAG Cheat Sheet

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project using LangChain with MongoDB for message history ‚Äì This project focuses on legal documents, allowing users to select relevant legal PDFs based on their input using semantic similarity and then generate responses accordingly.

## üöÄ Features
‚úÖ Semantic Similarity-Based Legal PDF Selection  
‚úÖ Integration with LangChain for RAG  
‚úÖ Efficient Retrieval and Query Processing for Legal Documents  
‚úÖ MongoDB Integration for Message History Storage
